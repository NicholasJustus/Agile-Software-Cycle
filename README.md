This repository is for my Software Lifecycle class. It covers the Agile development process, including sprint planning, project work, and reflections on using Agile methods like Scrum.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

Understanding user needs is key to building effective software. I start by gathering requirements and breaking them down into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. User stories help simplify complex features into smaller, more manageable tasks, making it easier to track progress and ensure the final product meets expectations. They also improve communication with stakeholders by providing a clear roadmap of what needs to be built.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future work?

I follow an Agile approach to software development, focusing on iterative progress, continuous feedback, and adaptability. I begin with sprint planning, setting priorities, and breaking tasks into achievable goals. Throughout development, I use daily stand-ups to track progress and backlog refinement to adjust priorities as needed. Moving forward, I plan to continue using Agile practices like Kanban boards, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to keep development efficient and flexible.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating effectively, collaborating with the team, and staying adaptable. Agile development relies on active participation, problem-solving, and supporting teammates when needed. A strong team player not only focuses on individual tasks but also contributes to the team's overall success by being open to feedback, refining work when necessary, and ensuring smooth collaboration throughout the project.
