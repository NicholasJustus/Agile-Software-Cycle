# Agile-Software-Cycle
This repo is for my Software Lifecycle class. It covers the Agile development process, including sprint planning, project work, and reflections on using Agile methods like Scrum.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs is essential for building effective software. I interpret user needs by gathering requirements, refining them into user stories, and ensuring they include clear acceptance criteria. Creating user stories helps break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks, making it easier to track progress and ensure each feature aligns with user expectations. It also improves communication between the development team and stakeholders by clearly defining what needs to be built.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I follow an Agile approach to software development, focusing on iterative progress, continuous feedback, and adaptability. I start by planning sprints, setting priorities, and breaking work into small, achievable tasks. Throughout the development process, I incorporate daily stand-up meetings to track progress and backlog refinement sessions to adjust priorities when needed. In the future, I hope to continue using Agile practices such as Kanban boards, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure efficient and flexible development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating effectively, collaborating with others, and being adaptable to changes. In Agile development, teamwork is essential for meeting project goals, and this includes actively participating in discussions, offering solutions, and assisting teammates when needed. A good team member is also open to feedback and willing to iterate on their work to improve the overall quality of the project.
